# Diffusion-Maps-Classical-Shadows

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that explores the application of diffusion maps to classical shadows in quantum computing. Our work builds on the concept of classical shadows to efficiently chart phase diagrams of quantum systems by employing diffusion maps for dimensionality reduction and analysis.

## Getting Started

To run the notebook, ensure you have Python installed, along with Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6+
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab

### Installation

First, clone this repository to your local machine. Then, install the required Python packages:

pip install -r requirements.txt


## Running the Notebook

After installation, launch Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab, navigate to the cloned repository, and open the `Diffusion_Map_on_Classical_Shadows.ipynb` notebook.
